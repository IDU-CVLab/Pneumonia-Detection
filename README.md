# Database:

* The dataset used for verifying the COVID-19 methods on Pneumonia cases from CT images is at [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3y55vgckg6/1](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3y55vgckg6/1)
* The method to be verified is our COV19D first run of the competition 2021, [here](https://github.com/IDU-CVLab/COV19D)
* The dataset used for training the CNN model to include Pnumonia cases is a combination of the COV19-CT-DB first run and the Pnomonia cases mentioned above.
* 4 CT scans (test-59, 61, 62, and 63) of the Common Pnomonia were used for training. Oversampling by 28 times duplication were deployed on the training set
* 2 CT scans (test-64 and 65) were used for validation.
